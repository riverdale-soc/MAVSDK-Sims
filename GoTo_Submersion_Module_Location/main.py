RTL Mode navigates the vehicle from its current position to hover above the home position.
The behavior of the mode is determined by the vehicle's home_location and the RTL_ALT parameter.

THe copter will rise a minimum of RLT_CLIMB_MIN meters or to RTL_ALT, whichever is higher, before returning home.
The default value for for RTL_ALT is 15 meters.

This means if you execute an RTL in Copter, it will return to the location where it was armed.
