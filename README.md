# MAVSDK-Sims
Collection of our MAVSDK-Python Simulations for Experimentation

Based on UAV-MOBFinder Project, we need to simulate the following processes individually, then integrate them as a project:
* [X] Connect and wait for Arming
* [x] Begin Guided Launch to a given altitude
* [x] GoTo GPS based on Submersion Module location
* [ ] Load Start Auto Mission
* [ ] Simulate YOLO Inference/GPS Approximation Guidance
* [ ] Send MOB/Drone Coordinates to GCS
* [x] Loiter at Altitude
* [x] Land at Home Base

## To Run
on Dmitri Lab PC:
Start Docker container holding DroneKit SITL (https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-sitl.git) Framework. 

```
sudo docker run -it --privileged  --env=LOCAL_USER_ID="$(id -u)"  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro  -e DISPLAY=:0  -p 14556:14556/udp  -p 8080:8080  evans000/uav-sitl bash
```
Change to Home directory
```
cd /home
```
To run a sub module in this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/riverdale-soc/Drone-Kit-Sims.git
cd Drone-Kit-Sims
cd <a simulation of choice>
python <the python simulation of choice>
```

To run a SITL example simulation: 
```
git clone https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python.git
cd dronekit-python/examples
cd /<some_example>
python <example_proj>.py
```
Currently the following sims are tested and known to work as is:
* Channel Overrides
* Create Attribute
* Flight Replay
* Vehicle State
* Simple GoTo
* Set Altitude Target
* MicroGCS
* Guided Set Speed Yaw
* Mission Basic
* Mission Import Export
* Performance Test

### Sample goto Simulation
